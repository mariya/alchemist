      <common:generalComment xml:lang="en">The data set is part of a LCA study on copper products. The study is based on recent industry data supplied by the European copper industry, and thus reflecting the reality in copper semis fabrication. In comparing copper architectural sheets with other roofing and facade materials by means of Life Cycle Assessment should be based on the functional unit, with a sheet thickness of 0.6 mm. This thickness is the most commonly available in the market today for roofing purposes. The use phase of copper roofing is one of the longest, easily reaching well beyond 100 years. Copper church roofs still functional after more than 500 years are known. The type of covering and the inclination of the roof should also be considered. The mass of one my of sheet may not necessarily be equivalent to one my of roof or one my of building surface. The specific properties of each material, the underlying support structures and the design all need to be considered. Many cradle to grave life cycle assessment studies have shown that the environmental aspects from the use and end of life phases of products are often much more significant. The economic value of copper scrap, based on its ability to be recycled 100% without any loss in performance, must be included in comparative assessments.</common:generalComment>

      <technologyDescriptionAndIncludedProcesses xml:lang="en">Copper sheet is basically made of copper cathode (virgin copper) and scrap from outside as well as process internal scrap e.g. turnings, cuttings. The process route for copper cathode can be region specific e.g. Outokumpu process, Mishibishi prcess, El teniente process, etc. The production process in principle is based on similar technology worldwide. The database encompasses for both routes the state of the art as described in the EU document on Best Available Technology of IPPC. The process route encompasses the following steps: mining and processing (concentrate production), hydrometallurgy (leaching, solvent extraction, electro winning) and pyrometallurgy (smelting, converting, fire refining, electrolytic refining). Copper cathodes are produced from both, the hydro- and the pyrometallurgical route. The semi-fabrication process for copper sheet includes the process steps melting and alloying, casting and rolling. Raw materials for the production are copper ore and scrap (pyrometallurgy), as well as clean scrap (semi-fabrication). The background system is addressed as follows: Electricity, Thermal energy: The electricity (and thermal energy as by-product) used is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly the individual power plants in service are modelled according to the current national grid. This includes net losses and imported electricity. Second, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled. Third, the country-specific fuel supply (share of resources used, by import and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific properties (e.g. element and energy contents) are accounted for. Fourth, the import, transport, mining and exploration processes for the energy carrier supply chain are modelled according to the specific situation of each power-producing country. The different mining and exploration techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different exploration countries are accounted for according to current engineering knowledge and information. Steam: The steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to the technology efficiencies and energy carriers used. Efficiencies range from 84% to 94% in relation to the representative energy carrier (gas, oil, coal). Coal, crude oil and natural gas used for the generation of steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity). Transports: All relevant and known transport processes used are included. Overseas transport including rail and truck transport to and from major ports for imported bulk resources are included. Furthermore all relevant and known pipeline and / or tanker transport of gases and oil imports are included. Energy carriers: Coal, crude oil, natural gas and uranium are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity). Refinery products: Diesel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, basic oils and residues such as bitumen are modelled via a country-specific, refinery parameterized model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refinery techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption,...) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country. Hence the refinery products used show the individual country-specific use of resources. The supply of crude oil is modelled, again, according to the country-specific crude oil situation with the respective properties of the resources.</technologyDescriptionAndIncludedProcesses>

The length of time where data is collected has been one production year. Geographical coverage: Worldwide data were included for the mining and processing unit as well as for the hydrometallurgy process units. For the pyrometallurgy process unit, industry specific data were collected from all major European copper smelters/ refiners. Data for semi-finished production is taken only from representative major European semi-fabricating sites, whereby it is assumed that their production is similar and representative for all European fabricators. Technology coverage: All major technologies, relevant to the European LCI, are included for mining, pyrometallurgy and fabrication. Hydrometallurgy is considered in the worldwide data collection. Further descriptors, which define the nature of the data, such as that collected from specific sites, versus data from published sources, and whether the data was measured, calculated or estimated, are also considered. For the transport of materials and energy carriers average transport processes with specific setting parameters e.g. transport distances and route (ship, pipeline, rail, road) are used.</dataSelectionAndCombinationPrinciples>
